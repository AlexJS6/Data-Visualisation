# Data-Visualisation
type of challenge: **alone**.   
Duration: **5 days**.  

The mission is, in a given code, create 2 *charts* from data tables, and another chart from remote data that has to be retrieved via *AJAX*.  

### **Site:**  [Data Visualisation](https://alexjs6.github.io/Data-Visualisation/.)

Used Languages:  
* Javascript
    * DOM manipulation
    * AJAX/FETCH request
    * library 
        * chart.js

## **EVALUATION** 

The evaluation method chosen is a self-evaluation based on the following indicators:

#### 1. handling of the DOM:

 - [x] I was able to find the right selector to do it.  
 - [x] I was able to inject the graph in the right place on the page via javascript.  
- [x] I was able to retrieve the html data in a format adapted to my javascript code.

#### 2. Request ajax/fetch:

 - [x] I was able to receive the answer from the remote server in json.
 - [x] Then, I was able to build a callback function to process this data.  

#### 3. Use of third party libraries:

 - [x] I was able to integrate the third-party library into my application.
 - [x] I used the documentation provided by the library.
 - [x] I was able to generate the 2 inline data graphs.
 - [x] I was able to generate the "remote data" graph.

#### 4. Problem-solving:

 - [x] Syntactic rigor: I was able to translate the processes I imagined into javascript syntax.
 - [x] Logical thinking: Through iterations and trial and error, I was able to find a logical path that works to address the issues raised by the client's request. Specifically:
 - [x] I was able to generate the 2 inline data graphs.
 - [x] I was able to generate the "remote data" graph.
 - [x] I was able to build a callback function to process remote data (received via ajax).
 - [ ] I was able to make the realtime graph refresh in real time.
 - [x] I was able to display the detailed data when I hover the mouse.
#### 5. Debugging:

 - [x] I use the console to understand what is happening and compare what I am trying to program with what the machine is doing.

#### 6. Separation of concerns:

 - [x] If I disable javascript, the user experience is satisfactory, the user has access to data and content
 - [x] If I enable javascript, the tables are enhanced with an interactive graph.
